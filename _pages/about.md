About Me
=======
Hello! Here is **Bufan Sun (孙不凡)**. I am embarking on a joint MPhil-PhD program in the Department of Information Systems (IS) at the School of Business and Management, **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**. I earned my Bachelor's degree from **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)**, majoring in Financial Engineering with a focus on Quantitative Finance, complemented by a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I am fourtuate to supervised by [Prof. Hong Xu](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/hxu) in my incoming research journey. Additionally, I am grateful for the guidance and support I received from [Prof. Chenglong Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/chenglong-zhang/home) and [Prof. Qiyuan Deng](https://qiyuan-deng.github.io/) during my undergraduate studies.

My current research interests revolve around the **economic impacts of blockchain applications** such as DApps and token-based platforms. I am particularly focused on utilizing analytical/stylized model to understand the effects of tokenization and decentralization. Besides, I am also interested in stochastic modelling tools, like stochastic differential equation (SDE), stochastic process, and optimal control. As a student majoring in financial engineering, I have gained internship experience in trading funds and acquired skills in quantitative research. I also dedicate my free time to conducting further research in this field.
